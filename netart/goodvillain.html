<p>You and this villain start fighting and realize how untrained you are in combat. Every single interaction with the villain you are constantly evolving his fighting moves. 20 minutes of near death experience, you are about to punch the villain with full forces, but your subconscious tells you no. You figure out an alternative and decide to just capture the villain.  </p>
