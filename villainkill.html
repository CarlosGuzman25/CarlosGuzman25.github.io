<p>You feel so much anger because you had a fight with your best friend and see a villain attacking the city. Villain says, "who do you think you are?" Villain starts running towards you. You charge your punch and then BOOM. One punch and he's dead. You realize that you just killed someone and now in shock. The civilians that you saved are now screaming and running away from you. Your only reaction was to web away.:</p>
