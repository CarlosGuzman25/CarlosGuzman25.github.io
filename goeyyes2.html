<p>You successfully went to your friends house without being detected. You snuck into their room and waited in there until they came back home. You waited for about 20 minutes and you realize your friend is a hero. Captain America! You swiftly punch Captain America without realizing because it wasn't you that punched him, it was the symbiote suit forcing you. You two start fighting and your friend is trying to help you, but also fighting back. You struggle to fight against the suit and for brief second you get in control. He grabs his shield and you see him that he's gonna uppercut you with the shield. Do you:</p>

<a href="goeyyes3.html">Let THE Captain America uppercut you so you can end the suffering of the suit and have him extract the suit from you</a>
